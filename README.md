As part of my internship task, I created a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to showcase my skills, projects, and personal background in a clean, user-friendly, and visually appealing format. This experience not only helped me improve my front-end development skills but also gave me hands-on exposure to designing and structuring a responsive and professional-looking website.

The portfolio is structured into multiple sections, including a homepage, an about section, a project showcase, and a contact form. The homepage provides a brief introduction and sets the tone for the website with a welcoming message and a profile image. The about section highlights my background, education, interests, and technical skills. This part was essential in giving visitors a quick overview of who I am and what I can bring to the table.

The projects section includes links and short descriptions of the work Iâ€™ve done so far. Each project is presented with a title, a brief summary, and, where applicable, a link to a live demo or GitHub repository. This allows potential employers or collaborators to quickly explore my work and understand the kind of projects I have worked on.

The contact section includes a simple form that allows visitors to reach out to me directly. It includes fields for name, email, and message, and is styled with CSS to fit the overall aesthetic of the site. Throughout the website, I used CSS to style elements with attention to layout, color schemes, fonts, and responsiveness. I applied Flexbox and media queries to ensure the site looks good on various screen sizes, including mobile devices.

This project gave me a deeper understanding of web development principles and helped me realize the importance of both visual design and code structure. It was a valuable learning experience that will serve as a strong foundation for more advanced web development tasks in the future.
